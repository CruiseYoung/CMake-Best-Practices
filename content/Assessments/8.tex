\begin{enumerate}
\item 
Commands that are added with add\_custom\_command are executed at build time, while commands that are added with execute\_process are executed at configuration time.

\item
One signature is used to create custom build steps, while the other is used to generate files.

\item 
Only POST\_BUILD is reliably supported across all generators.

\item 
Variables can be defined either as \$\{VAR\} or as @VAR@.

\item 
Variable substitution can be controlled by either passing @ONLY, which only replaces variables defined as @VAR@, or by specifying the COPYONLY option, which does not perform any substitution at all.

\item 
With cmake -E, common tasks can be executed directly. With cmake -P, .cmake files can be executed as scripts.
