As with the previous chapters, the examples are tested with CMake 3.21 and are run on either of the following compilers:

\begin{itemize}
\item 
The GNU Compiler Collection 9 (GCC 9) or newer, including the cross-compiler for the arm hard float (armhf) architecture.

\item 
Clang 12 or newer.

\item 
Microsoft Visual Studio C++ 19 (MSVC 19) or newer.

\item 
For the Android examples, the Android Native Development Kit (Android NDK) 23b or newer is required.

\item 
For the Apple-embedded examples, Xcode 12 or newer and the iOS Software Development Kit 12.4 (iOS SDK 12.4) are recommended.
\end{itemize}

All examples and source code are available in the GitHub repository for this book. If any of the software is missing, the corresponding examples will be excluded from the build. The repository can be found here: \url{https://github.com/PacktPublishing/CMake-Best-Practices}.
