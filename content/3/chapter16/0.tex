It has been a long journey since we started, and we have learned a great deal about CMake. But as you may have figured by now, CMake is a huge ecosystem, and one book is not enough to cover the vast number of topics that can be discussed. Thus, in this chapter, we are going to take a look at the resources that may help you to get to know CMake even better and also the ways of getting involved in the CMake project itself.

CMake is a flexible tool and used in many projects in the software industry. As a result, CMake has an ever-growing community supporting it. There are plenty of resources available online for learning and troubleshooting the CMake problems that you may experience.

To understand the skills shared in this chapter, we'll cover the following main topics:

\begin{itemize}
\item 
Where to find the CMake community

\item

\end{itemize}
