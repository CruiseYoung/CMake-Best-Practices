As you already know, CMake is open source software developed by Kitware. Kitware maintains development activity for CMake in a dedicated GitLab instance at \url{https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake}. Having everything available as open source and transparent means that getting involved in CMake is pretty easy. You can view the issues, merge requests, and get involved in the development of CMake. If you believe you have discovered a bug in CMake or want to make a feature request, you can create a new issue at https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/-/issues. If you have an idea about improving CMake, discuss that idea by creating an issue first. You can also take a look at open merge requests at \url{https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/-/merge_requests} to assist in reviewing the code being developed.

Contributing to open source software is crucial for the sustainability of the open source world. Please don't hesitate to help the open source community in whatever ways are convenient. The help you provide may only be small, but small contributions quickly add up to greater achievements. Next, we will look at reading material that you may find useful.
