As with the previous chapters, all the examples are tested with CMake 3.21 and run on either of the following compilers:

\begin{itemize}
\item 
GCC 9 or newer

\item 
Clang 12 or newer

\item 
MSVC 19 or newer
\end{itemize}

For viewing the profiling data, a third-party viewer for Google trace format is needed; arguably the most widely used is Google Chrome.

Examples using ccache are tested with Clang and GCC but not with MSVC. To obtain ccache, use either the package manager of your operating system or obtain it from \url{https://ccache.dev/}.

All examples are available at \url{https://github.com/PacktPublishing/CMakeBest-Practices}.
