Before you dive further into this chapter, revisit Chapter 1, Kickstarting CMake to brush up the skills we learned in the chapter. This chapter follows the teaching over example approach, so it is recommended to obtain this chapter's example content from here: \url{https://github.com/PacktPublishing/CMake-Best-Practices/tree/main/chapter\_13}. For all the examples, assume that you will be using the container provided by this project: \url{https://github.com/PacktPublishing/CMakeBest-Practices}.
