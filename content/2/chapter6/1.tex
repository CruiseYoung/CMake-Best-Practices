Before you dive further into this chapter, you should have a good grasp of the content covered in Chapter 4, Packaging, Deploying, and Installing a CMake Project, and Chapter 5, Integrating Third-Party Libraries and Dependency Management. The techniques that will be used in this chapter are all covered in these two chapters. Additionally, it is recommended to obtain this chapter's example content from \url{https://github.com/PacktPublishing/CMake-Best-Practices/tree/main/chapter_6}. All of the examples assume that you will be using the development environment container provided by the project found at the following link: \url{https://github.com/PacktPublishing/CMake-Best-Practices}. This is a Debian-like environment that contains all the prerequisites installed beforehand. Commands and outputs may differ slightly if a different environment is used. If you are not using the provided Docker container, ensure that you have installed Doxygen, PlantUML, and Graphviz in your environment. Consult your package manager's index for installation details.

Let's dive into the realm of documentation by learning ways of generating documentation from existing code.
