As with the previous chapters, all the examples are tested with CMake 3.21 and run on either of the following compilers:

\begin{itemize}
\item 
GCC 9 or newer

\item 
Clang 12 or newer

\item 
MSVC 19 or newer
\end{itemize}

For the examples using build containers, Docker is needed.

All examples and source code are available on the GitHub repository for this book. For this chapter, the examples for the CMake presets and build container are in the root folder of the repository. If any of the software is missing, the corresponding examples will be excluded from the build. The repository is found here: \url{https://github.com/PacktPublishing/CMake-Best-Practices}.
