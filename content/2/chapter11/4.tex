In this chapter, we have learned about what fuzzing is and how we can utilize it in our CMake projects to detect bugs earlier and enhance the quality of software. Fuzzing allows us to harness computing power for discovering new and interesting test cases, which increases overall coverage and eventually leads to more stable software systems.

In the next chapter, we will be learning about cross-platform and cross-toolchain buildig with CMake.

See you soon in the next chapter!
