As with the previous chapters, all the examples are tested with CMake 3.21 and run on either of the following compilers:

\begin{itemize}
\item 
GCC 9 or newer

\item 
Clang 12 or newer

\item 
MSVC 19 or newer
\end{itemize}

Some of the examples for code coverage, sanitizers, and static code analysis require
GCC or Clang to run and will not work with MSVC. For running Clang on Windows, have a look at Chapter 8, Executing Custom Tasks with CMake, where toolchain files are introduced. Some examples need the Catch2 unit testing suite installed to compile. Some examples pull dependencies from various online locations, so an internet connection is required as well. 

In addition to a working compiler, the following software is used for the examples:

\begin{itemize}
\item 
Gcov and Gcovr for the examples on code coverage
	
\item 
Cppcheck, Cpplint, and include-what-you-use for the examples on static code analyzers
\end{itemize}

All examples and source code are available on the GitHub repository of this book at \url{https://github.com/PacktPublishing/CMake-Best-Practices}. 

If any of the software is missing, the corresponding examples will be excluded from the build.
