In this part, you will be able to set up a software project using CMake in a way that suits the vast majority of use cases. Chapters 4 and 5 will cover aspects of installing and packaging your project, dependency management, and the use of package managers. Chapters 6, 7, and 8 will be about integrating external tools into your CMake project to create documentation, ensure code quality, or do almost any arbitrary task required for building software. Chapters 9 and 10 will be about creating reusable environments for building projects and chapter and handling big projects from distributed repositories. And finally, Chapter 11 will show you how to facilitate fuzzing with CMake.
