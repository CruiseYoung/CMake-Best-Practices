As with the previous chapters, all the examples are tested with CMake 3.21 and run on either of the following compilers:

\begin{itemize}
\item 
GCC 9 or newer

\item 
Clang 12 or newer

\item 
MSVC 19 or newer
\end{itemize}

Additionally, some examples will need OpenSSL 1.1 installed to be able to compile. Some examples pull dependencies from various online locations, so an internet connection is also required. All of the examples and source code are available from the GitHub repository to this book, which can be found at \url{https://github.com/PacktPublishing/CMake-Best-Practices}.

The examples for the external package managers require Conan (version 1.40 or newer) and vcpkg installed on your system to run. You can get the software here:

\begin{itemize}
\item 
Conan: \url{https://conan.io/}

\item 
Vcpkg: \url{https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg}
\end{itemize}
