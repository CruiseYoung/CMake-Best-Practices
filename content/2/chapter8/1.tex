As with the previous chapters, all the examples are tested with CMake 3.21 and run on either of the following compilers:

\begin{itemize}
\item 
GCC 9 or newer

\item 
Clang 12 or newer

\item 
MSVC 19 or newer
\end{itemize}

All the examples and source code for this chapter are available in this book's GitHub repository at \url{https://github.com/PacktPublishing/CMake-BestPractices}. If any of the software is missing, the corresponding examples will be excluded from the build.
