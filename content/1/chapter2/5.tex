In this chapter, we covered the fundamental methods of interacting with CMake, which
are the CLI and the GUI. We also covered various IDE and editor integrations that are essential for daily workflow. Using any kind of tool requires knowledge of how to interact with it. Learning ways of interaction allows us to better utilize the tool itself and to reach our goals easier.

In the next chapter, we will be talking about the building blocks of a CMake project, which will enable you to create a well-structured, production-ready CMake project from scratch.
