n the previous chapter, we got acquainted with CMake and learned about CMake's fundamental concepts. Now, we are going to learn how to interact with CMake. We shall do so by learning to configure, build, and install the existing projects. This will enable you to interact with CMake projects.

This chapter will take a look into what CMake has to offer as an interface and inspect some of the popular IDE and editor integrations. This chapter will cover the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item 
Using CMake via a command-line interface

\item 
Using cmake-gui and ccmake interfaces

\item 
IDE and editor integrations (Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, and Qt Creator)
\end{itemize}


Since we have a lot to cover, let's not waste any time and get started with the technical requirements.
