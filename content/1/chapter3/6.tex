Now that you've completed this chapter, you're ready to create applications and libraries with CMake and start building more complex projects than just "hello world." You have learned how to link different targets together and how compiler and linker options can be passed to targets. We also covered object libraries for internal use only and discussed symbol visibility for shared libraries. Finally, you learned how to document these dependencies automatically so that you have an overview of large projects.

In the next chapter, you will learn how to package and install your applications and libraries on different platforms.
