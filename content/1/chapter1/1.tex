To run the examples in this chapter, you will need a recent C++ compiler that understands C++17. Although the examples are not complex enough to require the functionality of the new standard, the examples have been set up accordingly.

We recommend using any of the compilers listed here to run the examples:

\begin{itemize}
\item Linux: GCC 9 or newer, Clang 10 or newer
\item Windows: MSVC 19 or newer or MinGW 9.0.0 or newer
\item macOS: Apple Clang 10 or newer
\end{itemize}

To try out any examples in this book, we have provided a ready-made Docker container that contains all the requirements.
